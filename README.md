In this project, I learned a lot about integrating a frontend with a backend, handling CRUD operations, and working with different databases. Initially, I used SQL Server but switched to MongoDB because I faced challenges uploading the database online. The main challenge, however, has been deploying the project. I'm still working on it and currently facing some port-related issues.
